"Although the stokeholder(s) currently have no plans for a commercial release, they recognise the potential of the project and believe it should be further developed.
As such, they recommend releasing an "early version" to the public, complete with all relevant media and advertising materials via the standard paths.
The feedback and response from the public will determine whether or not the project should be expanded.
Basically, treat this section of the project as though it is be made public via non-commercial channels. (e,g. itch.io)"
