# Software Engineering (Stevie)
The team decided to avoid prescribing to any single methodology for the project. Instead, it was suggested that the team use a combination of agile methodologies. Taking inspiration from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K20e7jlQPA) by No Boilerplate, the team used an agile methodology that avoided using ceremonies such as sprints, stand-ups and estimation. Instead, a set of tasks was created to kick off development and additional tasks were added to the backlog when needed. This allowed the team to work on their tasks without unnecessary overhead, increasing productivity.

## Version Control
Git version control was used throughout the project.
Uploaded to GitHub, we were able to ensure that the project was available to every member of the team and work wouldn't be lost.
Using Git for version control was an obvious choice given the prevalence of Git in industry, support in IDEs and prior experience of team members.
We decided to migrate from JetBrains Space to GitHub between assessment 1 and assessment 3 because team members were more familiar with it and it has better tooling.
Some additional features of note include webhooks (for updates directly in Discord), GitHub Desktop (for members who don't use an IDE) and the CLI.
We took advantage of GitHub's pull request capabilities by using [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).
This lightweight workflow is simple and encourages frequent commits and reduces the chance of merge conflicts down-the-line. We didn't have any issues applying it in the project.

## Project Planning
It was evident to the team that project planning was going to be a crucial part of working as a team. We considered various solutions, ranging from Trello to JetBrains Space.
However, it was eventually decided that GitHub was the most suitable platform to host our repository on.
As a consequence, it was only natural that we leveraged GitHub's Issues & Projects. GitHub issues offered a practical way of:
- Documenting tasks
- Describing the work that needs to be completed
- Categorizing tasks (e.g. bug, feature, documentation, etc.)
- Tracking task completion
- Assigning tasks to team members
- Discussing tasks without flooding the team group chat
GitHub Projects serves as an extension to GitHub Issues and provides the ability to create a project timeline, prioritise tasks and provide more incremental information about the state of a task.
Using these tools, we were able to create an at-a-glance Gantt chart for the project and organise the project in a clear, transparent matter.
